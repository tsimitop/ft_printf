ft_printf is one of the initial projects at the 42 core curriculum.

The goal of the project is to further familiarise the students with the use of the C programming language.
More specifically it serves as an introduction to variadic functions as it is meant to mimick the printf function's behaviour.

I have now learnt that it is easy to cause stack overflow so I would probably avoid it.
